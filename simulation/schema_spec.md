## Design patterns to cover

- Group membership
- Transitive hierarchy
- Transitive category membership
- Data-sourcing/prediction/location nested relations

# Patterns

### Attributes

- Relation to attribute

- Attribute of attribute

- Attribute of attribute of attribute

- Attribute hierarchies

- All attribute datatypes

- Implicit relations, and adding new roleplayers to them

### Relations

Ternary and N-ary relations, with interesting numbers of roleplayers per role

- Symmetric and antisymmetric relation

- Transitive relation

- Reflexive relation (`data-sourcing` as an example relation, or a court ruling, which could be on another ruling)

- The anti-transitive and anti-reflexive are defined easily by the lack of a transitive rule or a reflexive role

- Relation, entity and attribute playing two roles in a relation

- Ragged role hierarchy - subtype some roles of a relation but not others, and subtype relations with new roles

## Rule formulations
- Inferred relation
- Inferred role, existing relation
- Inferred attribute
- Inferred attribute using value from the `when`
- Inferred complex type
- Inferred entity (useless but why not)
- Successive/compound/recursive rules

## World elements to model

- Trade between companies
- Governments and elections
- Legal system
- Taxation and finance
- Currency
- Scientific measurements
- Immigration/emmigration, residency
